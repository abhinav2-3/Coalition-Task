## Description:

Hey there,

I'm thrilled to present my skills test for the front-end position at [Coalition Technologies](https://coalitiontechnologies.com/). This assessment is all about showcasing my ability to bring a vision to life, taking an Adobe Photoshop file and turning it into a dynamic, responsive single-page web application.

My main task? Transforming the provided PSD into a sleek, user-friendly website that looks fantastic on any device. From seamlessly adjusting the carousel for different screen sizes to making sure the tabs smoothly transition into an accordion layout on mobile, I'm all about enhancing usability.

But that's not all. I've gone the extra mile by adding internal links to the 'History' and 'Team' sections, making navigation a breeze for users. Plus, I've sprinkled in a bit of magic with a parallax scrolling effect on the hero image for that extra wow factor on desktop.

Ready to see the magic unfold? Let's dive in!
